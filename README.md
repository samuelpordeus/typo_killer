# Typo Killer
### _qu'est que ce_
![CI badge](https://github.com/samuelpordeus/typo_killer/workflows/Elixir%20CI/badge.svg)

#### Building

With elixir installed, open `typo_killer` folder and use the following commands
on your terminal:

```
mix deps.get
mix compile
```

#### Simple Usage

**Using iex**

Open an iex session:

```
iex -S mix
```

Then just: `TypoKiller.find_typos("path/to/folder")`

**Using mix**

Just run `mix typo_killer path/to/folder`

#### Creating a binary

This will create a self contained executable file which will include everything
that you need to run TypoKiller. This file can be distributed to other people
and they don't need to have an Erlang runtime installed - it's all in the
binary file.

To create it, run:

```
mix escript.build
```

This will generate an executable file `bin/typokiller`. Now run
`./bin/typokiller --help` for more information.
